## Features

- **Layouts:** tile, grid, monocle, deck, scroller, and floating, with per-tag
customization

- **Tags:** organize windows with tags instead of workspaces, with shift-tags
support

- **Rules:** regex pattern matching for window rules

- **Modes:** separate keybindings for each mode (default, lock, passthrough,
custom)

- **Window States:** swallow, maximize, fullscreen, fake fullscreen, floating,
sticky

- **Autostart:** run commands on startup

- **Status Bar:** dwm-like bar, supporting static text, stdin, and fifo, with
  customized colors

- **Configuration:** support both compile-time and runtime configuration,
  reloading on the fly

See the default [configuration](./config.def.zon) file for detailed features.

## Dependencies

- wayland (libwayland-client)
- xkbcommon
- pixman (if bar enabled)
- fcft (if bar enabled)
- wayland-protocols (compile only)

## Build

Requires zig 0.15.x.

```zig
zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseSafe
```

- `-Dconfig`: specify the default config file path (defaults to `config.zon`,
  copied from `config.def.zon` if missing)
- `-Dbackground`: enable or disable the solid background (defaults to `false`)
- `-Dbar`: enable or disable the status bar (defaults to `true`)
- `--prefix`: specify the path to install files

## Configuration

### Compile Time

Make custom modifications in `config.zon` (if `-Dconfig` is not specified).

### Runtime

`kwm` searches for a user configuration in the following paths:
- `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/kwm/config.zon`
- `$HOME/.config/kwm/config.zon`

The user configuration overrides compile-time configuration. You only need to
specify the values you want to change, rather than duplicating the entire
configuration.

User configuration can be reloaded on the fly with
<kbd>mod4</kbd>+<kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>r</kbd>.

## Usage

Run `kwm` in your river init file, or start it with `river -c kwm`.

See `kwm(1)` man page for complete documentation.

See [Useful Software] in river wiki for compatible software.

### Keybindings

See `KEYBINDINGS` section in `kwm(1)` for default keybindings.

### Keymaps

Keyboard mapping can be customized by setting XKB layout rules before launching
river. For example, to swap <kbd>CapsLock</kbd> with <kbd>Escape</kbd>, and <kbd>Mod1</kbd> with <kbd>Mod4</kbd>:

```sh
export XKB_DEFAULT_OPTIONS=caps:swapescape,altwin:swap_alt_win
```

See `man 7 xkeyboard-config` for all options.
